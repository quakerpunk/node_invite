# Node Invite

We had a client that wanted to set up an invitation/registration system for events they held throughout the year. We found a module that would do the job - Node Invite. The only problem? Our client was on Drupal 7 and there wasn't a version of Node Invite for Drupal 7 (as of 1/17/17, there still isn't.) So we updated the module. We added integration with another module called [Previewable email templates](https://www.drupal.org/project/pet).
